Yesterday I received 1E (hex) messages from my friend , and I replied exactly 1010 (bin) times ! He was SHOUTING (low) at me because I forgot to call him back . I told him it was a honest mistake , not a intentional one . He said ' I understand , but next time please remember ' and I promised I would . 

The conversation started when he mentioned that he bought a orange , a apple , and a umbrella from the store . I thought that was a amazing (up, 2) coincidence because I had just bought the same items ! We both laughed and decided to meet at the coffee shop downtown .

When we met , he was wearing a shirt that said ' BEST FRIEND EVER ' (low, 3) which made me smile . We talked about our plans for the weekend and he suggested we go hiking in the mountains (cap, 4) . I agreed enthusiastically and said ' that sounds like a excellent idea ' !

During our hike , we saw FF (hex) different types of birds and 11001 (bin) beautiful flowers . The weather was perfect and we took many photos . At one point , he pointed to a tree and said ' look at that MAGNIFICENT (low) oak tree ' . I had to admit it was truly spectacular .

On our way back , we stopped at a restaurant where the waiter greeted us with ' welcome , gentlemen ' . We ordered our favorite dishes and talked about old times . The bill came to 2A (hex) dollars , which we split evenly . Before leaving , I told him ' this has been a wonderful day (up, 3) ' and he agreed completely .

As we parted ways , he reminded me about a upcoming event next week . He said ' don't forget about the party on saturday (cap) ' and I promised I wouldn't . It was a perfect end to a amazing day with a old friend .
