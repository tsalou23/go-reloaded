Yesterday I received 30 messages from my friend, and I replied exactly 10 times! He was shouting at me because I forgot to call him back. I told him it was an honest mistake, not an intentional one. He said 'I understand, but next time please remember' and I promised I would. The conversation started when he mentioned that he bought an orange, an apple, and an umbrella from the store. I thought that was An AMAZING coincidence because I had just bought the same items! We both laughed and decided to meet at the coffee shop downtown. When we met, he was wearing a shirt that said 'BEST friend ever' which made me smile. We talked about our plans for the weekend and he suggested we go Hiking In The Mountains. I agreed enthusiastically and said 'that sounds like an excellent idea'! During our hike, we saw 255 different types of birds and 25 beautiful flowers. The weather was perfect and we took many photos. At one point, he pointed to a tree and said 'look at that magnificent oak tree'. I had to admit it was truly spectacular. On our way back, we stopped at a restaurant where the waiter greeted us with 'welcome, gentlemen'. We ordered our favorite dishes and talked about old times. The bill came to 42 dollars, which we split evenly. Before leaving, I told him 'this has been A WONDERFUL DAY' and he agreed completely. As we parted ways, he reminded me about an upcoming event next week. He said 'don't forget about the party On Saturday 'and I promised I wouldn't. It was a perfect end to an amazing day with an old friend.
